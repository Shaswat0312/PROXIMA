## 🌍 Overview

URJAX is an AI-powered infrastructure intelligence platform designed to detect long-term structural inefficiencies in power grids.

Unlike traditional energy systems that focus on real-time monitoring and short-term forecasting, URJAX identifies persistent underutilization, renewable energy curtailment, and macro-level demand–supply imbalances.

It transforms raw grid data into explainable, policy-ready optimization insights.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Despite billions invested in power generation and renewable infrastructure, large portions of installed capacity operate below optimal utilization.

### Key Challenges:
- Persistent regional underutilization  
- Renewable energy curtailment  
- Long-term demand–supply imbalance  
- Rising per-unit electricity costs  
- Lack of structural inefficiency detection systems  

Current tools monitor operations.  
**URJAX detects structural inefficiency.**
